Our lab has an opening for a postdoc scholar to explore how dynamic species interactions shape food webs. Some familiarity with modelling and statistics is needed. This project will involve analysis of time series analysis with existing tools (sensu Sugihara et al 2012), as well as opportunities to pursue marine- or theory-focused research. 

If youâ€™re interested, please email Vadim a description of your research interests, goals for your postdoc, and a CV to start a conversation.


For prospective graduate students:
Graduate students in the lab use dynamical models to answer as their primary methodology (i.e., using mathematical modeling and computer simulations). This may entail a primarily theoretical thesis or a thesis that combines dynamical models, statistics, and existing data to answer questions in a specific system. Students pursue their own research questions. Simultaneously, we look to create a supportive, collaborative atmosphere where lab members learn from and help each other.  Applicants would be expected to have a strong background in data science or mathematical modeling. We hope your interests include one or more of the following: resilience, population dynamics, and questions involving time series or spatial pattern analysis.

Selecting an advisor that suits your interests and needs is critical to being happy and successful. To start a conversation, please drop Vadim an email with:
* Your CV
* An unofficial transcript
* Research interests (including why you want to work in this lab)
