<!--We have an opening for a theory postdoc scholar to explore how key aspects of nature shape the diversity-stability paradox in ecosystems - [please see the ad here](/files/Postdoc ad 2025.pdf). -->

<!--We also have an opening for a funded PhD student inteested in theory and analyzing field data on food web dynamics. -->

We're always looking for graduate students and postdocs from biology or applied math who have a keen interest and a little experience (courses or reading stuff) in ecology. Graduate students typically apply for the NSF graduate research fellowship or and NSF postdoctoral research fellowship.

If youâ€™re interested, please email Vadim a description of your research interests, goals for your postdoc, and a CV to start a conversation.

&nbsp;

For prospective graduate students:

Graduate students in the lab use dynamical models as their primary methodology (i.e., using mathematical modeling and computer simulations). This may entail a primarily theoretical thesis or a thesis that combines dynamical models, statistics, and existing data to answer questions in a specific system. Students pursue their own research questions, so having some prior research experience is required. Applicants would also be expected to have a strong background in data science _or_ mathematical modeling. We also all actively work to create a supportive, inclusive, and collaborative atmosphere where lab members learn from, help, and inspire each other.

Selecting an advisor that suits your interests and needs is critical to being happy and successful. We hope your interests include one or more of the following: **ecosystem resilience, population dynamics, marine ecology, and questions involving time series or spatial pattern analysis**. To start a conversation, please drop Vadim an email with:
* Your CV
* An unofficial transcript
* Research interests (including why you want to work in this lab specifically)

We are a new lab and have a wonderful mathematical biology community at UMD comprising the labs of Bill Fagan (theoretical ecology, animal movement), Joshua Weitz (microbial ecology, epidemics), Emme Bruns (plant-pathogen eco-evo), Phillip Johnson (immune dynamics), Abba Gumel (math, epidemics), and Michelle Girvan (physics, networks).
