<!--We have an opening for a quantitative postdoc scholar to explore how dynamic species interactions shape food webs - [please see the ad here](/files/Postdoc ad 2024_2.pdf). This project will involve analysis of time series analysis with existing tools (rooted in [Sugihara et al 2012](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1227079)), as well as opportunities to pursue marine- or theory-focused research. -->

We're always looking for graduate students and postdocs from biology or applied math who have a keen interest and a little experience (courses or reading stuff) in ecology. Vadim is also happy to help you write an NSF graduate research fellowship or and NSF postdoctoral research fellowship (sadly these are only available to US citizens or permanent residents).

If youâ€™re interested, please email Vadim a description of your research interests, goals for your postdoc, and a CV to start a conversation.

&nbsp;

For prospective graduate students:

Graduate students in the lab use dynamical models as their primary methodology (i.e., using mathematical modeling and computer simulations). This may entail a primarily theoretical thesis or a thesis that combines dynamical models, statistics, and existing data to answer questions in a specific system. Students pursue their own research questions, so having some prior research experience is required. Applicants would also be expected to have a strong background in data science _or_ mathematical modeling. We also all actively work to create a supportive, inclusive, and collaborative atmosphere where lab members learn from, help, and inspire each other.

Selecting an advisor that suits your interests and needs is critical to being happy and successful. We hope your interests include one or more of the following: **ecosystem resilience, population dynamics, marine ecology, and questions involving time series or spatial pattern analysis**. To start a conversation, please drop Vadim an email with:
* Your CV
* An unofficial transcript
* Research interests (including why you want to work in this lab specifically)

We are a new lab and have a wonderful mathematical biology community at UMD comprising the labs of Bill Fagan (animal movement), Joshua Weitz (microbial ecology, epidemics), Emme Bruns (plant-pathogen eco-evo), Phillip Johnson (immune dynamics), and Abba Gumel (epidemics).
