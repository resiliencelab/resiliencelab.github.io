<h3> Postdocs:</h3>

<img align="right" width="115" src="/files/photos/amy_lake.png">
**Amy Patterson** I'm a theoretical ecologist with interests in population dynamics, eco-evolutionary dynamics, and invasive species. I use mathematical and statistical models to understand and predict how species react in a changing world.

I use a combination of math and field data (and inevitably stats) to study catastrophes and network dynamics. I love finding novel dynamics in biological complexity and then finding the simplest models that capture those novel dynamics.
