**Amy Patterson** I'm a theoretical ecologist with interests in population dynamics, eco-evolutionary dynamics, and invasive species. I use mathematical and statistical models to understand and predict how species react in a changing world.

<h3> Students:</h3>

We have two summer interns using attractor reconstruction to forecast climate change impacts on malaria epidemics.

<h3> PI:</h3>
**Vadim Karatayev** I use a combination of math and field data (and inevitably stats) to study catastrophes and network dynamics. I love finding novel dynamics in biological complexity and then finding the simplest models that capture those novel dynamics.
