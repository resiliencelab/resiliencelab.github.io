**Amy Patterson** I'm a theoretical ecologist with interests in population dynamics, eco-evolutionary dynamics, and invasive species. I use mathematical and statistical models to understand and predict how species react in a changing world.

**Așa Rishel**
Asa is a math undergraduate interested in systems of differential equations, applications of PDEs, and parametric vs. nonparametric modeling techniques. Outside of the lab, Asa’s research is delay-differential equations of COVID-19 and its effect on depression.

**Helia Eshaghi**
Helia is a biology undergraduate working on forecasting outbreak and range shifts of epidemics such as Malaria and Dengue fever with climate change using Empirical Dynamic Modelling.

**Vadim Karatayev** I use a combination of math and field data (and inevitably stats) to study catastrophes and network dynamics. I love finding novel dynamics in biological complexity and then finding the simplest models that capture those novel dynamics.
