Environment and species composition often vary across a landscape. Do ecological dynamics – the emergent ‘clockwork’ – change from place to place as well? 

To surmount the near-lack of data on this, we model landscape dynamics by leveraging spatial patterning, individual trait, and spatial time series data. This informs classical debates among competing hypotheses and reveals locations most sensitive to disturbance (climate change, invasions).

Fisheries. Across 36 species, population dynamics vary greatly among locations. This was often due to gradients, for instance when all populations share a thermal response curve, but die-offs happen only in southern populations where absolute temperatures are greater. The ongoing loss of latitudinal temperature and productivity gradients on the US Northeast Shelf, then, could homogenize dynamics and cause frequent, large-scale population declines. In revision.
